			<li>Running around the East Bay</li>
			<li>Inhaling books</li>
			<li>Getting owned in dodgeball and knockout</li>

		<h2>A ramble on two horses.</h2>
		<p>About a month ago, I learned about the two-horse rule. It goes like this: if one horse can pull 700 pounds and another horse can pull 800 pounds, how much weight will they pull when yoked together?</p>

		<p>The arithmetic answer would be 1500 pounds. But two horses, when yoked together, can pull <strong>3000 pounds</strong>. Huh?</p>

		<p><em>Synergy: the cooperation of two or more agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.</em></p>

		<p>I've seen synergy at work when I run. On my own, I can be an unmotivated bum. But when I run with my fellow bum...</p>

			<p>13% improvement when two bums run together.</P> 
				<p>But synergy is also dependent on your choice of companion. Times where synergy was my enemy: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Cramming for a midterm with Michell<em>. Study killer.</em></li>
					<li>Abstaining from ice cream with Jane. <strong>15 bars. 3 days. <em>GONE.</em></strong> </li>
					<li>Trying to run to Main Island Bridge with Rachel...it broke her spirit.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Lesson learned: choose the other horse wisely.</p>
